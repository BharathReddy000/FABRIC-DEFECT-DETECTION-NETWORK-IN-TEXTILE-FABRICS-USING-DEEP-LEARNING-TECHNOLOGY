## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Automated quality guarantee of textile fabric materials is one of the most important and demanding computer vision tasks in textile smart manufacturing. 
This survey presents a thorough overview of algorithms for fabric defect detection. 
First, this review briefly introduces the importance and inevitability of fabric defect detection towards the era of manufacturing of artificial intelligence.
Second, defect detection methods are categorized into traditional algorithms and learning-based algorithms, and traditional algorithms are further categorized into statistical, structural, spectral, and model-based algorithms.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Real-time Processing: The system should be able to process and detect defects in real-time to maintain production speed.
- Visualization Tools: Visualize the model's attention on specific regions of the fabric to understand its decision-making process.
- Integration with Manufacturing Systems: Integrate the system with existing quality control systems to flag defective fabrics and halt production if necessary.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.
